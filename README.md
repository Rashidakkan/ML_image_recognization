Description:
This project is my first foray into machine learning, where I've implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition using the popular CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, making it an excellent starting point for image classification tasks.

Key Components:
Python Language: The project is implemented using Python, leveraging its rich ecosystem of machine learning libraries, including TensorFlow and Keras.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): I've designed and trained a CNN architecture, a deep learning model well-suited for image-related tasks. 
CNNs excel at capturing hierarchical features in images through convolutional and pooling layers.
CIFAR-10 Dataset: The CIFAR-10 dataset has been used for training and testing the model. It includes images across classes such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more.
GitHub Repository: The entire project, including code, model checkpoints, and documentation, is available on my GitHub repository. This makes it easy for others to access, collaborate, and learn from my work.

Objectives:
Achieve high accuracy in classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Explore and fine-tune CNN hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Document the project for easy understanding and future reference
